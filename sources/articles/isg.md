!=!=! Intro: Start
I began a PhD with the Information Security Group (ISG) at Royal Holloway in September 2015 as part of the Cyber Security CDT. The CDT is set to take 4 years to complete during which I will be exposed to a wide variety of topics relating to the security of computing devices such as static and dynamic program analysis, cryptography, and network security.
