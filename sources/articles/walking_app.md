!=!=! Intro: Start
Throughout 2013 and 2014 I was part of a small agile development team which was tasked with creating a program capable of giving historical information on walks through the Magna Carta site in preparation for the 800 year anniversary of its signing.
!=!=! Intro: End

The project required the development of a visual editor, a web frontend, an Android and iPhone application and a server backend. All of the application front ends and the editor interacted with a server which enabled us to easily create and display a large database of information about the site in a formatted way. The server also allowed the entire database to be dumped in JSON, which allowed for offline viewing of the walks, an important feature as the Magna Carta site had limited wireless data coverage.
