!=!=! Intro: Start
Kiniro is a game (and accompanying game-engine) from developed from scratch. For this work I created a 2.5D platforming game engine compatible with Linux, Mac OS X, and Android. The engine is entirely written in C++ and includes support for physics through a homebrew physics engine, sound through OpenAL, and large 2D animations.

As the game develops further I hope to build a set of tooling to allow for easy creation of pseudo-3D maps (3D models which can only be traversed in the x and y axis. In addition particle and post-processing systems are planned so that the game can be given a unique look. The source code is currently not public, but if you are interested in taking a look then feel free to contact me.
