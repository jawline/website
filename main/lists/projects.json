To that end I developed a new LISP style language with a AOT compiler. The project was developed in C++ and includes a LL(1) parser, a AST structure and a AST -> Machine code JIT converter. The resulting language is a simple integer only language which supports recursion and function arguments.</p>"}, {"title": "Scribble", "id": "scribble", "date": "2013 to 2015", "create_date": 1533825900, "tags": ["projects", "programming-languages"], "human_time": "2018-08-09 14:45:00", "desc": "<p>For my university dissertation I designed and implemented a programming language and virtual machine. The language was designed to make extending existing C++ applications easier and to enable users to extend a programs functionality, increasing the usefulness of a piece of software.
