<a-intro><p>As a recent hobby project I have been working to improve my knowledge of ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. To that end I developed a new LISP style language with a AOT compiler. The project was developed in C++ and includes a LL(1) parser, a AST structure and a AST -> Machine code JIT converter. The resulting language is a simple integer only language which supports recursion and function arguments.</p></a-intro>
