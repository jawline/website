!=!=! Intro: Start
Parrot is an opinionated static website generator written in Ocaml. A static website is a website that requires no application server, it is just a series of HTML pages served by a HTTP file server with no special application logic. Parrot creates a static website from a series of markdown articles and a website template, producing a website artifact that can be deployed to almost any HTTP server. The website template does not need to include any JavaScript or CSS dependencies, and is particularly well suited to lightweight blog generation. Parrot is used to create my personal website.
